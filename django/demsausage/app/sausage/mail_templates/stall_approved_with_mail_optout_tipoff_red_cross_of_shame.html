Hi there,
<br />
<br />
Good news! The tip-off you sent to Democracy Sausage about about a polling place without any stall has just been
approved. We've given them a big red cross of shame on the map now.
<br />
<br />
You submitted the following information:
<br />
<br />
Polling Place: {POLLING_PLACE_NAME}, {POLLING_PLACE_ADDRESS} <br />
Source: {TIPOFF_SOURCE}
<br />
<br />
If you'd like to see the stall on the map, you can use this link:
<a href="{STALL_PERMALINK}">{STALL_PERMALINK}</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Would you like to hear more from us?</strong>
<br />
Now that we've approved your tip off, we've added you to our mailing list. Don't worry, we'll only ever send emails
around
election-time in your state or territory. (And we won't sell your email to spammers - promise!)
<br />
<br />
Still, if you'd like to opt-out and unsubscribe from our mailing list you can do so <a

<br />
<br />
Thanks again for sending us a tip-off!
<br />
<br />
Team Democracy Sausage
