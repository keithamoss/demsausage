# April 1st 2019 Data Quality Issues

## Wrong location (AEC notified; fixed by-hand)

1. Charleville High School: -26.395960, 146.259221
2. Mile End: -34.923374, 138.570222

## Duplicate polling places (temporarily renamed by-hand)

1. Bedfordale North (Burt) (PPID=70737) and Armadale East (PPID=7468) are the same premises and location - Pioneer Village School. We've temporarily renamed Armadale East to "Bedfordale North (Canning)" so it gets deduplicated by the data loader.

## Missing locations (AEC notified; polling places skipped)

1. Oakleigh (Higgins) (PPID=34017)
2. Warwick (PPID=7588)
3. Sorrento Beach (PPID=32446)
4. Beverley (PPID=7982)
5. Gingin (PPID=7934)
