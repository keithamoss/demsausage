See `config.json` for machine-readable fixes.

### Wrong address (AEC notified; polling places skipped)

1. Tansey (PPID=6625) has an address and premises that doesn't match the location and division provided. "Tansey Hall, 35 Tansey Hall Rd" is in Tansey (Postcode 4601). The location provided is in Tin Can Bay (Postcode 4580) in the division of "Wide Bay". The latitude/longitude provided is close to "Regis Care Queensland" - this may be the correct polling place?

### Duplicate polling places (temporarily renamed by-hand)

1. [AEC FIXED] Bedfordale North (Burt) (PPID=70737) and Armadale East (PPID=7468) are now known as "Armadale East (Burt)" and "Armadale East (Canning)".

## April 1st 2019

### Wrong location (AEC notified; fixed by-hand)

1. Charleville High School (PPID=6131): -26.395960, 146.259221 (was -26.40316, 146.24092)

### Duplicate polling places (temporarily renamed by-hand)

1. Bedfordale North (Burt) (PPID=70737) and Armadale East (PPID=7468) are the same premises and location - Pioneer Village School. We've temporarily renamed Armadale East to "Bedfordale North (Canning)" so it gets deduplicated by the data loader.

1. Oakleigh (Higgins) (PPID=34017) and Oakleigh (Hotham) (PPID=3906)
2. Wollert South (PPID=83636)

4. Sorrento Beach (PPID=32446)
