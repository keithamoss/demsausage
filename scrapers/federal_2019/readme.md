# Usage Instructions

We need to merge the official AEC data with an unofficial list of overseas polling booths.

1. Add a `booth_info` column as the far right most column.
2. Paste the contents of `./data/overseas_polling_places_2019.csv` (minus the header) at the bottom of the file.
3. Load the polling place data per normal whilst applying `config.json`.
