				<Question>What is this?</Question>
				<Answer>A map of sausage and cake availability on election day.</Answer>

				<Question>I still don't understand</Question>
				<Answer>It's practically part of the Australian Constitution. Or something.</Answer>

				<Question>But how do you get all of the sausage sizzles?</Question>
				<Answer>
					<p>
						We crowdsource (or is it crowdsauce?) data from social media, the web, and from the stalls that people
						submit to us on this here website.
					</p>
					<p>
						To let us know about sausage and cake availability (or the absence thereof), the best method is to use the
						"Add stall" functionality on our website - you can submit as either a stall owner or just a 'tip-off' as
						appropriate. You can also contact us via our various social media channels listed below.
					</p>
					<p>
						To make this work, we've also used Australian Electoral Commission polling place data (likewise from the
						state and territory electoral commissions).
					</p>
					Democracy Sausage incorporates data that is Â© Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Electoral Commission){' '}

				<Question>What does the halal symbol indicate?</Question>
				<Answer>
					<p>
						Firstly, it's important to note that our site can't actually provide halal certification, and we display the
						symbol based on information submitted to us by the folks running the stalls themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						The halal symbol we use is widely understood by our users to indicate halal. (From what we understand, it is
						just one of a variation of halal seals / stamps that are used in Australia - though we're happy to be
						corrected on that). For the curious, the ABC's Bush Telegraph has more in their segment{' '}
						<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/bushtelegraph/halal/5843904">
							What's the big fuss about Halal certification?

				<Question>Who are you?</Question>
				<Answer>
					<p>We're six people, three children, three cats, and some birds.</p>
					<p>
						Well, that and a whole bunch of dedicated and hard working volunteers on election days who help out with
						crowdsaucing sausage sizzle locations.
					</p>
					<p>

				<Question>Who do we need permission from to run a sausage sizzle fundraiser at our school?</Question>
				<Answer>
					Well your school or polling place host site, first of all. Beyond that, your local government may require you
					to get a permit to run a temporary food stall - so give them a call to find out. There's also some pretty
					basic food safety regulations you'll need to abide by - check out foodstandards.gov.au{' '}

				<Question>Are you part of any political parties?</Question>
				<Answer>Nope! Democracy Sausage is 100% non-partisan, organic, hormone free, and grass fed.</Answer>

				<Question>Will you share my info with others?</Question>
				<Answer>
					<p>
						If you submit a stall to us, we won't share any personal information about you - such as your email address,
						social media handle, et cetera.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do occasionally work with other websites to share data about sausage sizzles, but we only ever send them
						information about the stalls and locations and polling booths.
