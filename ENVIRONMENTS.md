## Secrets

```
sausage-web.env
sausage-db.env
rq-dashboard.env
redis.env
cloudflare.env
```

## Redis

Or it'll complain about some permissions errors.

```
chown 1001:1001 redis
```

# Cloudflare

## New A records

```
staging.democracysausage.org
staging-admin.democracysausage.org
staging-public-redesign.democracysausage.org
staging-rq.democracysausage.org
```

## SSL Certs

```
mkdir keys && cd keys
nano wildcard.democracysausage.org.pem
nano wildcard.democracysausage.org.key
```

**Note:** We can't use `staging.[foboar].democracysausage.org` because the Cloudflare Free plan doesn't cover more than one level of wildcards for Edge Certificates. It'd be at least USD$10/month to upgrade to a plan that allows it.

**Note:** We created a new Origin Server certificate that claims to cover more than the original one when we thought we should use `staging.[foboar].democracysausage.org`, so in practice it really just covers the same domains as the cert in prod and exists to differentiate it from that prod cert.
